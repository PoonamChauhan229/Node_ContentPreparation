Starting to set up the database server on our machine.
how we can connect to that database from no J.S
thereafter, perform CRUD as Well

we're gonna talk about the database where we'll be using to store our userdata that is Mongo D.B..

We will be stoing the JSON data.

MongoDb is a great choice for NodeJS developers

MongoDb  falls under a different category of database called NOSQL database

SQL Stands for Structured Query Language
NOSQL Stands for Not Only Structured Query Language

SQL 
database:
    we can create databases as our application needs
Tables:
    we have tables to store the data
    -Rows and cols we have
         >user data=> store users data(table1)
        >task data=> store task data(table2)
    -Row is referred as row or record
    4 columns we have.



MongoDb
database:
    we can create database as our application needs
Collections:
    >we can have many collections for our application
        >user data=> store users data(collection1)
        >task data=> store task data(collection2)
 1 entry is knaown as document
 documents like JSON {id:"",etc}
 in mongodb its reffered as feilds, it has 4 feilds.

 installation:
 Download and innstall

 mongosh download separately and paste it

MongoDb Docs
Lets go the MongoDb Docs
https://www.mongodb.com/

Docs:
http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/?jmp=docs

We are going to connect to your Mongo DB database from a nodeJS application
and we are going to learn CRUD as well.

Now to get all of this done we'll be using the MongoD.B. native driver.

For that we are going to use the NPM Module and its going to allow us to interact with our database from node 

Let's head over to the browser and explore this native driver.
http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/?jmp=docs

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/

https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native

This is the documentation , we will be using it .

>Create taskmanager
cd taskmanager

npm install mongodb
npm init -y

Now, we are ready and perform all the CRUD operations

crud
 so create mongodb.js
 
 insertOne
 insertMany

 ObjectId:
 _id:
 this field is automatically created by Mongo D.B. and it stores a unique identifier for each document you insert into the database.

these server generates the I.D. for new records and it follows that auto incrementing integer pattern where the first record has the idea of one.

the ids are known as GUI.D. which stands for globally unique identifiers and these are a bit different.
