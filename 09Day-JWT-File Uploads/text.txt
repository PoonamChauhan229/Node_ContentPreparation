data sorting filtering and Pagination, Timestamps
=====================================================
>Working with the Timestamps:

how we can enable Timestamps for our Mongoose models.
Doing this for both our users and our tasks.

enabling an option that's going to add it to new fields one called created at and a another called updated at.
Both are going to store timestamps so they're going to store the moment in time when that event occurred

We have to customize these schema we've created.
{
    timestamps:true
}
Added to both the schemas.

========================================================
Filtering out the data.
Task Route:
get all Task route.

setting up the query string:
/tasks?completed=true
/tasks?completed=false

req.query.completed

Now, we have populate the tasks
.populate({
        path:'tasks',
        match:{
                completed
        }
})


===========================

Pagination:
limit
skip

limit=>limit allows us to limit the number of results we get back for any given request.
skip means how much no of data at the start you want to skip.
/tasks?limit=2&skip=2
Well we have access to set on options is both limit and skip
options:{
        limit:2,
        skip:2

}

===============================================================
Sorting Data:

Sort the Data in a specific Order:
=> SOrt the task when they were last created or last updated
=> SOrt the task by completed(-1) or incompleted(1)
1st by fields and then by asc(1) desc(-1).

/task?sortBy=createdAt_asc
/task?sortBy=createdAt_desc

OR

/task?sortBy=createdAt:asc
/task?sortBy=createdAt:desc


options:{
        sort:{
                createdAt:1//asc
                createdAt:-1//desc
        }
}
