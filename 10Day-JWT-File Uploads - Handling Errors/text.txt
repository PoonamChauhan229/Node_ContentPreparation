Handling Error:
how to customize the errors that get sent back when the file upload fails.

Whether it's because the file is not of the right type or whether it's because it's too large and doesn't meet the file size limitation we've set.

Either way we can go ahead and send back a Jason error message instead of trying to render this HTML

===================
Now, Add Images to the User Profile.

how to create a link between the image uploaded and the user who actually uploaded it?

Right now all of the Avatar pictures are being dumped into a directory and there's no link between the user who created it and the image that was uploaded.

This route isn't even behind authentication so those are all things we want to fix.

=>put the route behind authentication
=>then we'll create a place on the User model for the image data to be stored.

=>finally we'll be creating a separate route that authenticated users can use to delete a profile picture they've set.

the only difference is that this route already has one piece of middleware in place that is multer

So we want to make sure they're authenticated before we worry about accepting their upload because if they're not authenticated we would never accept the upload.

So initially, it was directly getting stored to the destination folders.
so we will remove that from the destination folder.
as we remove now it will pass the image, but wont save to the destination folder.
As we want to save it to the user profile.

Once its saved, to the database,
let check out in the browser
so we will copy the binary data of avatar and head it towards the browser.

We will use Jsbin
https://jsbin.com/

<img src="data:image/jpg;base64, binary image data"/>

Another approach to render the image
