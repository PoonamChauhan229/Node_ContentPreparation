Express:

we're going to start learning about one of the most popular NPM libraries-That is Express

Express makes it really easy to create web servers with node these servers are going to allow us to serve up all of the assets for our web application

This includes 
HTML=>to render to the screen 
CSS=>to style our application
client side JavaScript=>so we can set up all sorts of awesome user interaction 

now using Express,We're also going to be able to serve up JSON data


Today, we're going to create and run your very first nodeJS based server

This is going to offer users an entirely new way to interact with your applications instead of needing to run commands from the terminal to interact with your app.We'll be able to visit a URL and by the end of this session ,you can visit in the browser to interact with your NodeJS application with the node server.

This would include HTML documents CSS files to style the page client side JavaScript and maybe some images

Express is one of the original NPM packages and it's one of my favorite express definitely helped put no JSA on the map back in the day because it made it so easy to create web servers whether you wanted to serve up something like a static website or whether you wanted to create a complex HTTP JSON based API to serve as the backend for something like a mobile or web application.

First, is to get an basic server up and running.
Lets start
npm init -y
npm i express
Create a folder src
> WE will stay more organized so we are doing it.
src> app.js

Now,
It would be nice if we could write our HDL in separate H2 CML files and have the express server serve those up and we can.
So what we're gonna do is configure express to serve up an entire directory of assets that could contain HTML files CSS s files client side JavaScript videos images and more.
So let's go ahead and start this process off.

let's create the directory
>public
    >index.html and other assests files

index.html=> create a very basic HTML file and it will be served by default.
So this is the page that will eventually show up at the root of our Web site.

Use EmmetAbrevation and create a basic template.
